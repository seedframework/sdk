<h2>What is Seed?</h2>
<p>Seed is a multiplatform C++ game development framework that aims mainly at recompile only portability between a wide range of platforms and consoles.</p>

<h2>Why Seed was created?</h2>
<p>Seed was created mainly to enable recompile only portability for games and taking full advantage of C++ performance. It is also designed to be "non-C/C++ developer friendly" (ie. targeting Flash/AS2/AS3 developers), trying to avoid most commons C++ problems for newbies and mitigating other common game development problems.</p>

<h2>Who made Seed?</h2>
<p>Seed was created by Danny Angelo Carminati Grein (maintainer and architect), Everton Fernando Patitucci da Silva (developer) and Rafael "Raptor" Eduardo Gonchor (developer) and is being developed at TechFront Studios and as a hobby by us and other contributors.</p>
