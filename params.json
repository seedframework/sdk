Some planned and in development features include shaders, bone animation, render to texture, integrated scripting system and full game editor with live preview.\r\n\r\nCurrently 2.0 is under closed development on bitbucket until a stable build with all core features. It is a rewrite of the version 1.0 that was used in 15+ commercial casual games.\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\nTotally free license BSD-like, use it as you wish!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated, developed and maintained by Danny Grein (@fungos) with some help from Everton Patitucci (@patuti) and others.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact fungos at gmail or PM in github!"}
